					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>One difficulty that I faced was trying to get the links on my homepage to work properly.

				<h2>Results</h2>

					<p>Task 3 - I edited the template present in the "lab3" index file. It was then a matter of adding these screenshots and a link to return to the homepage.</p>
