					<h2>Today's Challenge</h2>
					<p>"Working with your partner, experiment with JS events."</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>I had an issue with setting up the button for the JavaScript function. It turns out that I placed some code outside of the function by mistake! I also managed to puzzle out how to change the output text, I just forgot to add a semicolon in the CSS.</p>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>This assignment went by a lot faster than I thought it would. I didn't feel like going all out because I had other assignments to deal with.</p>

					<h2>Results</h2>
					<p>Place your name here for sorting!</p>
