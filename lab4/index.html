					<h2>The Challenge</h2>
					<p>Make pseudocode outlines of an everyday task and a simple computer game. Then turn those outlines into comments in the code.</p>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>Most of the problems we faced were deciding what game to pseudocode. And, how to break that pseudocode down into tasks and subtasks</p>

			//Making Connect Four:
				//Print the board before each turn
				//Loop through each row
				  //Loop through each space
					//Print X, O, or space
					//Print a | in between
				  //Print a new line at the end
				  //Print a horizontal line in between
			  //Accept user input
				//Ask user for input
				//Proceed
			  //Validate user move
				//Make error message if move is invalid
				//Proceed normally if not
				//Update the board (Add user’s icon: O)
			  //Evaluate possible moves
				//Check columns if they have an empty space
				//Mark columns with empty space valid
			  //Choose computer move
				//Choose valid move
				//Update the board (Add computer’s icon: X)
			  //Test for win or draw condition
				//Win Condition: 4 icons are in a row horizontally, vertically, or diagonally
				//Draw Condition: No more possible moves, and win condition isn’t reached.

				<h2>Reflection</h2>
				<p>I found this assignment to be rather simple, and I had a great deal of enjoyment in going through it. Most of my energy was spent setting up the submission PDF and helping my partner.</p>
