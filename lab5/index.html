					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>"With a partner, experiment with basic JavaScript data types and variables."</p>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>My biggest problems with this assignment were that I couldn't find a partner, and I didn't have a car. 
						I ultimately had to work on my own and use the car example from lab 6.</p>

					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>I believe that this assignment in particular didn't go very well. I had an important essay due earlier, and it led to one time management mishap after another.</p>
