					<h2>Today's Challenge</h2>
					<p>"Working with your partner, experiment with DOM manipulation."</p>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>The main problem I faced was simply trying to get the button to work. I had accidentally forgotten to put any actual code inside the click listener. I also had to take some time transcribing lyrics to replace the original "Lorem ipsum" text.</p>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Results</h2>
					<p> I'm here to present: The lyrics of "don't touch my pizza >:(" in the form of endless gibberish! (This song belongs to zombycare)</p>
