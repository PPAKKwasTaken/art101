			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Today's Challenge</h2>
					<p>"Working with your partner, experiment with jQuery."</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>The main problem I struggled with was getting my buttons to work. For each section, 2 buttons were appearing at a time. I realized that I had forgotten to delete some leftover code from the previous lab that would run JavaScript code. This leftover code would cause my current code to run twice.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>Despite being more complicated, I found this lab a lot less stressful since my partner and I weren't working on it on the day of the due date.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Results</h2>
					<p>Click on any of the "PINK-IFY MY TEXT" buttons!</div>p>
