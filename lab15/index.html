					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>"Working with your partner, experiment with jQuery and AJAX."</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>I struggled with implementing the Chuck Norris API (chucknorris.io) and making it give a random Chuck Norris joke each time its pressed. I was not specifying that I needed the value data from the API, only that it output the "data," which meant all of it! </p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>The implementation was easy in hindsight, but I was hard for me to focus on this assignment because I had to deal with big assignments in other classes (with their due-dates being around the corner).</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Results</h2>
						<img src = "img/chuck_norris.jpg"></img>
						<p>Ready for some Chuck Norris jokes? That was a rhetorical question, of course you are!</p>
